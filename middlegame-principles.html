        <h1>Middle Game Principles</h1>

        <div class="intro-box">
            The middlegame is where chess becomes truly complex and creative. After completing development, you must
            formulate plans, coordinate your pieces, and create threats. These principles will help you navigate the
            middlegame with confidence and purpose!
        </div>

            </div>
            <div class="principle-description">
                Never move without a purpose. After the opening, ask yourself: "What is my plan?" Common plans include:
                attacking the king, improving piece positions, creating pawn breaks, exploiting weaknesses, or controlling
                key squares. If you don't have a plan, improve your worst-placed piece.
            </div>
            <div class="example-box">

            </div>
            <div class="principle-description">
                Look for weak pawns and squares in your opponent's position. Weaknesses can't be defended by pawns:
                isolated pawns, backward pawns, doubled pawns, and squares that can't be controlled by pawns (holes).
                Direct your pieces toward these targets.

            <div class="principle-description">
                An outpost is a square deep in enemy territory that can't be attacked by pawns. Knights are especially
                powerful on outposts (usually on the 5th or 6th rank) where they control key squares and can't be easily
                driven away. Support your knight on an outpost with pawns.
            </div>

            </div>
            <div class="principle-description">
                A "bad bishop" is blocked by its own pawns on the same color squares. A knight can be superior to
                such a bishop. When you have a bad bishop, try to exchange it or place your pawns on the opposite
                color. When facing a bad bishop, fix their pawns on that color.
            </div>
            <div class="example-box">

            </div>
            <div class="principle-description">
                Having both bishops (the "bishop pair") is an advantage, especially in open positions. The two bishops
                control all colors and work well together. Try to keep your bishop pair and trade your opponent's
                bishops for your knights when possible.

            </div>
            <div class="principle-description">
                Pieces should work together toward a common goal. Uncoordinated pieces are easy to attack. Before
                launching an attack, make sure your pieces are supporting each other. This is called piece harmony.
                Doubled rooks, bishops aiming at the king, and pieces supporting advanced pawns are examples.

            </div>
            <div class="principle-description">
                The player who controls more squares has a space advantage. With more space, your pieces have more
                mobility and options. To gain space, advance pawns safely and control the center. When you have less
                space, trade pieces to reduce cramping.

                If you have more pieces on the kingside, attack there. If you have a pawn majority on the queenside,
                push those pawns. Don't attack where your opponent is stronger—you'll waste time and resources.
                Direct your forces where you have an advantage.

            <div class="principle-description">
                To successfully attack the king, you need open lines for your heavy pieces (rooks and queen). Use
                pawn breaks to open files and diagonals. Common breaks include f4-f5, g4-g5 on the kingside, or
                b4-b5, c4-c5 on the queenside.

            <div class="principle-description">
                A successful king attack usually requires at least 3-4 attacking pieces. Attacking with only one or

                This forces them to slow down their attack to defend.

                Is a rook passive? Find an open file. This simple principle always gives you something useful to do.

            <div class="principle-description">
                Don't just focus on your own plans—pay attention to what your opponent wants to do! If you see your
                opponent is planning something dangerous, prevent it. This is called prophylaxis (preventive thinking).
                Ask: "What is my opponent threatening? How can I stop it?"

            <div class="principle-description">
                In the middlegame, certain squares become critically important based on the pawn structure—usually
                squares in or near the center that can't be attacked by pawns. Fight to control these squares with
                pieces, and occupy them when possible. Controlling key squares restricts your opponent's pieces.

            <div class="principle-description">
                Before making a tactical move, calculate forcing sequences (checks, captures, threats) to see if
                your idea works. Calculate your opponent's best defenses. Don't rely on hope—verify with concrete
                calculation. This prevents blunders and helps you find winning combinations.
